## Concretizing symbolic values

When running greed, you will often find it helpful to concretize some symbolic values, for example, to inspect the actual value of a storage slot or to determine the concrete environment needed to reach a particular point in the execution (e.g., calldata).

Remember that:

(1) There are often inherent dependencies between symbolic values, and concretizing one might affect the satisfiability of the others. For example, to concretize the buffer of a `SHA3` operation, you will first need to concretize its offset and size, or to concretize the calldata buffer, you might need first to concretize the "calldatasize" as well ‚Äì unless it is already concrete or known:

```python
calldatasize = state.solver.eval(state.calldatasize, raw=True)
calldata = state.solver.eval_memory(state.calldata, calldatasize)
```


(2) When you set up a concrete transaction, you will need to provide values other than the calldata, for example, the value of msg.sender (`CALLER`) and the transferred amount (`VALUE`). You can derive all these values from your final state. For example:

```python
caller = state.solver.eval(state.ctx['CALLER']).to_bytes(20, 'big').hex()
callvalue = state.solver.eval(state.ctx['CALLVALUE'])
log.info(f'CALLER: 0x{caller}')
log.info(f'CALLVALUE: 0x{callvalue}')
```
